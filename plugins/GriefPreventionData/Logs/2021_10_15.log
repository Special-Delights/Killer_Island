05:53 Stabaho187      : i want to add a mobs one but i think its 40$
05:53 -TurningCupid   : there was a timber mod but it sucked if you were building with wood because if you were crotched then it the wood the whole build would fall
05:53 Stabaho187      : we have a tree feller plugin
05:53 Stabaho187      : use a axe and it takes the whole tree down
